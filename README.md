### 💻 The Tech Behind the Scenes

This project is built using a few core technologies that make it all work seamlessly.

  * **React:** Think of this as the main "engine" that builds all the different parts of the website, like the product cards and the shopping cart. ⚛️
  * **JavaScript:** This is the magic that makes everything interactive, from adding items to your cart to searching for games. 📜
  * **CSS:** This is what makes the website look awesome. It handles all the colors, layouts, and animations. 🎨

### 🧩 The Building Blocks

The whole website is made up of simple, reusable parts called components. This makes the code organized and easy to understand\!

  * **Product Card:** A mini card for each game, showing its picture and name.
  * **Navigation Bar:** The bar at the top with the logo, search bar, and cart icon.
  * **Shopping Cart:** The page that shows all the items you've selected.
